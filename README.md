# BeamLib.jl
BeamLib is a Julia package for the evaluation of various beamformers. 

While some other related packages do exist:

    - JuliaGNSS/PhasedArray.jl (https://github.com/JuliaGNSS/PhasedArray.jl)
    - Beamforming.jl (https://juliapackages.com/p/beamforming)
    - SignalAnalysis.jl (https://github.com/org-arl/SignalAnalysis.jl)

None of them are focused on simulation and evalution, support Unitful for usage of physical units, or
allow for deep customization.

New functionality will be added to this package as needed.
